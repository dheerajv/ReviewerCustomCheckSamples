#Topic : Create Custom Check (ArcGIS 10.4)

##Introduction
Custom checks are programs that can be incorporated into the ArcGIS Data Reviewer framework. These programs can be executed as individual checks or as part of a batch job. They can validate a specific set of features, an entire feature class or multiple feature classes/tables within a workspace.

     Note: This sample was created using ArcGIS 10.4 Data Reviewer and may be freely used and redistributed "AS-IS". 
     No technical support is provided.

[ArcGIS Data Reviewer](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/extensions/arcgis-data-reviewer/index.html) provides over 42 out-of-the-box [checks](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/data-reviewer/checks-in-data-reviewer.htm) that can be run individually or grouped into [batch jobs](http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/extensions/data-reviewer/batch-jobs-and-data-reviewer.htm) (.rbj files). If these included checks do not meet your specific requirements, these samples can help you write a custom check to meet your specific organization requirements.
